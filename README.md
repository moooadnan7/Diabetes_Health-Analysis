1. **Data Loading and Exploration**
   - Load the dataset using pandas.
   - Display the first few rows of the dataset.
   - Check for missing values and handle them if any.
   - Display summary statistics and data types of each feature.

2. **Data Analysis and Visualization**
   - Visualize the distribution of the target variable (`Diabetes_binary`).
   - Create histograms or count plots for key features like `BMI`, `PhysHlth`, `MentHlth`, `Age`, etc., to understand their distribution.
   - Use correlation heatmaps to identify potential correlations between features.
   - Create pair plots for selected features to understand their relationships.

3. **Feature Engineering and Preprocessing**
   - Handle any categorical features if present (e.g., encoding).
   - Scale numerical features using StandardScaler or MinMaxScaler to improve model performance.
   - Split the data into training and testing sets (e.g., 80% train, 20% test).

4. **Modeling: Logistic Regression**
   - Build a logistic regression model.
   - Fit the model to the training data.
   - Predict and evaluate the model on the test set using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
   - Plot the ROC curve and calculate the AUC score.

5. **Modeling: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
   - Implement the KNN algorithm.
   - Perform hyperparameter tuning for `n_neighbors` using cross-validation.
   - Evaluate the KNN model on the test set with the same metrics used for logistic regression.
   - Compare the ROC curves of logistic regression and KNN.

6. **Model Evaluation and Comparison**
   - Compare the performance of both models using confusion matrices.
